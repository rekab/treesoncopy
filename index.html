        <div class="about-content">
          <p>In the present-day, moody, Pacific Northwest, people go about their day like every other day, unaware of the environmental tragedies occurring around them. While some fight for the trees, others have come to accept there is no changing the status quo. Ash, heir to a logging empire, is at the center of it all and for them, life is easy. But when they are suddenly confronted with a life-changing decision, they are forced to reflect on their purpose in life: remain loyal to the firm, join the activists, or—carve a new path of their own. As Terra, the activists, and Wind, Water and Fire guide them, they contemplate what their legacy will be. Tensions rise between the loggers and activists, local and global needs, and the present and future in this love story between humanity and Earth. Ash's journey unfolds via a soaring soundtrack blending indigenous, Western and folk music, resulting in an Americana story which demonstrates how we each have the power to act to save the world. The question is… Will you play your part before it's too late?</p>
          <p class="about-italic">TREESON was conceived in April 2020 and has been in development for 5 years. Most recently it had a sold-out off-Broadway concert debut at 54Below on Earth Day. It was also a Eugene O'Neill Semi-finalist (2023) and received a truncated production at The Dairy Arts Center in Boulder, Colorado (August, 2022) produced by Parlando School of Musical Arts. The Original Cast Recording (demo) was released in 2021.</p>
          <p class="about-centered">*Special thanks to LBK, loyal environmentalist and the inspiration for this story.*</p>
