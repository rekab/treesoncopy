        <p>G. Victoria Campbell, Ph.D. (she/her) is a Seattle-based industrial-organizational psychologist turned artist-activist, playwright-composer-lyricist and poet. As a multiracial female who grew up feeling in-between and othered, she leverages her multicultural heritage, time living abroad as an expat in Switzerland, and her background in organizational change management to inform her art, which focuses on driving positive global change.</p>
        <p>She's best known for her original musical TREESON: AN ECO-MUSICAL (sold-out, off-Broadway concert '24, O'Neill Semi-finalist, '23; New Musical Festival, '22). Her other works include PHILIPPA (about Philippa Duke Schuyler with collaborator Stephanie Henry) and OFF WITH YOUR HEAD (a maternal love story about the Queen of Hearts with collaborator Nicolette Blount).</p>
        <p>Favorite spots where her music has been performed include 54 Below, The Green Room 42, Chelsea Factory, and the Union Theatre (London). She is a member of the legendary BMI Lehman Engel Musical Theater Workshop, the Dramatists Guild, MAESTRA, MUSE and the Seattle Composers Alliance where she serves on the Advisory Panel. She's also a Soho House Foundation Fellow ('23) and an artist-in-residence at The Tyrone Guthrie Center in Ireland ('24, '26) and Bethany Arts Community ('25). She writes music in many genres including musical theater, folk, pop-rock, nu jazz, melodic metal and Nordic EDM and is a frequent collaborator with MoEoStAr, The Churning Mondays and Jacob Didas.</p>
        <p>When she's not writing music, she designs and delivers custom Human Resources and DEIA solutions for client organizations via her consultancy.</p>
